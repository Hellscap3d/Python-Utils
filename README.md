# Python Utils

## WebImport
Useful for importing lots of web libraries without needing to download them.
This works by caching it
```py
from WebImport import Import
Based = Import("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hellscap3d/Based/main/Based.py")
# Then I would be able to use the library as normal, here I used one of my libs.
```
